= Differential splicing analysis

Create a directory dedicated to the splicing analyses within the `tutorial` folder:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir ../splicing
----

and move to it:

[source,cmd]
----
cd ../splicing
----

== Prepare input files

To generate alternative splicing (AS) events, we need the genome annotation restricted to exon features in the third field of the gtf file. In addition to that, we will filter it for protein-coding transcripts.

[source,cmd]
----
# List of transcript ids
awk '$3=="transcript" && $0~/gene_type "protein_coding"/{ match($0, /transcript_id "([^"]+)/, id); print id[1] }' /tutorial/refs/gencode.vM4.gtf |sort -u > protein_coding_transcript_IDs.txt

# Genome annotation restricted to exon features and filtered by transcript type
cat /tutorial/refs/gencode.vM4.gtf |awk '$3=="exon"' |grep -Ff protein_coding_transcript_IDs.txt > exon-annot.gtf
----

Also restrict the transcript expression matrix (TPM) to only proteing-coding transcripts. Refer to section <<Transcript and gene expression quantification>>. And generate individual files per tissue.


[source,cmd]
----
# Filter transcript TPM matrix
selectMatrixRows.sh protein_coding_transcript_IDs.txt /tutorial/quantifications/encode.mouse.transcript.TPM.idr_NA.tsv > pc-tx.tsv

# Individual transcript expression matrices
for tissue in Brain Heart Liver; do
    selectMatrixColumns.sh PRNAembryo${tissue}1:PRNAembryo${tissue}2 pc-tx.tsv > expr.${tissue}.tsv
done
----

== Generate local AS events

Extract alternative splicing events from a given genomic annotation of exon-intron gene coordinates. Types of events: Skipping Exon (SE), Alternative 5' (A5) or 3' (A3) splice sites (SS), Mutually Exclusive Exons (MX), Retained intron (RI) and Alternative First (AF)/Last (AL) Exons (FL). Check SUPPA detailed description link:https://github.com/comprna/SUPPA[here].

[source,cmd]
----
suppa.py generateEvents -i exon-annot.gtf -e SE SS MX RI FL -o localEvents -f ioe

----

Check how many local events were generated per type:

[source,cmd]
----
wc -l localEvents*ioe
----

Generate a barplot with the number of events found in the genome annotation. Use the R wrapper `ggbarplot.R`.

NOTE: Check parameters by typing `ggbarplot.R --help`.


== Compute percent spliced in index (PSI) values for local events

Compute PSI for local single exon skipping events (SE):

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
event=SE; suppa.py psiPerEvent --total-filter 10 --ioe-file localEvents_${event}_strict.ioe --expression-file pc-tx.tsv -o PSI-${event}
----

Create individual files per tissue:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
event=SE; for tissue in Brain Heart Liver ;do ~abreschi/utils/selectMatrixColumns.sh PRNAembryo${tissue}1:PRNAembryo${tissue}2 PSI-${event}.psi > ${tissue}.${event}.psi;done
----

Generate a barplot with the number of PSI values of SE events computed for both replicates of each tissue. 
Why these values vary per tissue?

Use the R wrapper `ggbarplot.R`. Color the bars by tissues using the palette `palTissue.txt` located in the `/tutorial/palettes` folder.

NOTE: Check parameters by typing `ggbarplot.R --help`.


== Differential splicing analysis for local events

Compute differential splicing analysis for SE events, comparing all tissues against all and performing multiple testing correction:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
event=SE; suppa.py diffSplice --method empirical --input localEvents_${event}_strict.ioe --psi Brain.${event}.psi Heart.${event}.psi Liver.${event}.psi --tpm expr.Brain.tsv expr.Heart.tsv expr.Liver.tsv -c -gc -o DS.${event}
----

Look at top cases and play with thresholds of p-value and delta PSI:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
event=SE; awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}NR==1{print }NR>1 && $2!="nan" && ($2>0.7 || $2<-0.7) && $3<0.05{print}' DS.${event}.dpsi
event=SE; awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}NR==1{print }NR>1 && $4!="nan" && ($4>0.7 || $4<-0.7) && $5<0.05{print}' DS.${event}.dpsi
event=SE; awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}NR==1{print }NR>1 && $6!="nan" && ($6>0.7 || $6<-0.7) && $7<0.05{print}' DS.${event}.dpsi
----

== Generate a heatmap with best examples 

Use the PSI vectors `.psivec` files and the R wrapper `ggheatmap.R`.

== Look at examples at UCSC genome browser

Have a look at the examples in the heatmap on the {UCSC_genome_browser}[UCSC genome browser^].

Highlight the skipped exon and zoom out to look at the entire gene loci.


== Functional analysis

Search for functional information of differentially spliced transcripts, using link:https://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Index[ENSEMBL] and other databases.
Check for domains, use transcript comparison tool, phenotypes, gene expression, etc.
 

== Perform PSI calculation and differential splicing analysis for other local event types

Repeat every analysis steps performed for SE events to other AS events. Start by checking MX and AF events.


== Generate plots and tables summarizing the analysis performed 

Generate a barplot with the number of PSI values computed per tissue (both replicates) per local AS event.

Generate a barplot with the number of top events per tissue were foudn at a chosen threshold of delta PSI (p-value<0.05).

Perform other summary statistics of the AS events, e.g. number of events found per chromosome or in the different strands.
