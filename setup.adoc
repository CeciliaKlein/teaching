In order to set up your environment for the hands-on you need to run the following command in your terminal:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
singularity shell -B /training/rg/rnaseq:/rnaseq \
                  -s /bin/bash \
                  /training/rg/rnaseq.simg

# create the rnaseq folder
mkdir ~/rnaseq

# move to the folder
