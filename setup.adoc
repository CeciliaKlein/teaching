= Setup

All the data needed for the course is stored in the following directory:

[source,bash,	subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
{base_folder}
----

We are going to run all the commands of the hands-on within a Singularity container. In order to run the container shell you need to run the following command in your terminal:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
singularity shell --bind {base_folder}{rnaseq_folder}:{rnaseq_folder} \
                  --shell /bin/bash \
                  {base_folder}/rnaseq.simg
----

You should get a similar output:

[source,bash]
----
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

(rnaseq) training@CZC8297PTV:~$
----

We are going to use the folder `{working_dir}` as our working directory. Create the folder within your home and move to it:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
mkdir {working_dir}
----

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
cd {working_dir}
----
