= Introduction

The RNA-seq data comes from brain samples (CNS) of mouse embryos at day 14 and day 18, done in 2 bioreplicates (1% of the reads are randomly sampled here).

In order to gain time, mapping, bigwig and quantification processes will only be done with one sample, however the analysis will use all 4 samples.

NOTE: The default working directory is the `rnaseq` folder inside your home directory, if nothing else is specified. You can use the `pwd` command to [crg]##**p**##rint your current [crg]##**w**##orking [crg]##**d**##irectory.

NOTE: A cheatsheet with basic Linux and Cluster commands is available <<{cheatsheet}>>.
