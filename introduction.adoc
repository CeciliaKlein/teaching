= Introduction

The RNA-seq data comes from brain samples (CNS) of mouse embryos at day 14 and day 18, done in 2 bioreplicates (1% of the reads are randomly sampled here).

In order to gain time, mapping, bigwig and quantification processes will only be done with one sample, however the analysis will use all 4 samples. For the splicing analysis all reads have been used to compute the junction counts.

When you are waiting for a job to complete, please look at the input, output and help of the different programs run until that point.

NOTE: The default working directory is your home, if nothing else is specified. You can use the `pwd` command to check your current working folder.

NOTE: A cheatsheet with basic Linux and Cluster commands is available <<{cheatsheet}>>.
