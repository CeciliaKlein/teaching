= Fastq files and read QC

Have a look at one of our fastq files:

[source,cmd]
----
zcat ~/rnaseq/data/mouse_cns_E14_rep1_1.fastq.gz | head -4
----

Create a folder for the fastqc output:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir fastqc
----

Create a bash script called `run_fastqc.sh`.

This script should contain the following command:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash -e

# load env
. ~/rnaseq/.rnaseqenv

# load module
module load FastQC/0.11.2

# run fastqc
fastqc -o fastqc -f fastq ~/rnaseq/data/mouse_cns_E18_rep1_1.fastq.gz
----

Submit the job to the cluster:

[source,cmd]
----
qsub -cwd -q RNAseq -l virtual_free=8G -N fastqc_rnaseq_course -e logs -o logs ./run_fastqc.sh
----

To monitor the status of the job, type `qstat`.

You are able to display the fastqc results on the browser. Type the following in the terminal to open a browser showing your FastQC results:

[source,cmd]
----
firefox ~/rnaseq/fastqc/mouse_cns_E18_rep1_1_fastqc.html
----

If you have an instance of firefox running in your local machine you need to modify the command as follows in order to be able to open the file:

[source,cmd]
----
firefox --new-instance ~/rnaseq/fastqc/mouse_cns_E18_rep1_1_fastqc.html
----
