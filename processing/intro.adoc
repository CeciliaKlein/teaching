Have a look at the `.rnaseqenv` file to see how the environment for the course has been configured.
We will use the `rnaseq` folder under your `HOME` as the base folder for the tutorial. Be sure you are
inside that folder before doing any processing. Use the `pwd` command to check your current folder
and `cd` to move to the `rnaseq` folder, e.g.:

[source,bash]
----
bash-4.1$ pwd
/users/rg/epalumbo
bash-4.1$ cd ~/rnaseq
bash-4.1$ pwd
/users/rg/epalumbo/rnaseq
----

Once you are inside the `rnaseq` folder, create a folder for storing the log files:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir logs
----
