Make sure you are inside the `rnaseq` folder in your home before doing any processing. Use the `pwd` command to check your current folder and move to the `rnaseq` folder if you are not there, e.g.:

[source,cmd]
----
pwd
----
----
/users/rg/epalumbo
----

[source,cmd]
----
cd ~/rnaseq
pwd
----
----
/users/rg/epalumbo/rnaseq
----

Once you are inside the `rnaseq` folder, create a folder for storing the log files:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir logs
----
