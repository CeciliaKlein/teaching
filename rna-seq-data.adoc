= RNA-seq data
:rnaseq_folder:
:base_folder: /software/rg/rnaseq/
:setup: {base_folder}env/setup
:env_file: ~/rnaseq/.rnaseqenv

All the data needed for the course is stored in the following directory:

[source,bash,	subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
{base_folder}
----

In order to set up your environment for the hands-on you need to run the following command in your terminal:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
{setup}
----

You should get a similar output:

[source,bash]
----

The script creates a `rnaseq` folder within your home, making soft links to the data in the main course folder. To start working, move to this newly created folder:

[source,cmd]
----
cd ~/rnaseq
----

and have a look at its contents:

[source,cmd]
----
ls -l
----
[source,bash]
----

There is one more important file linked during the setup that needs to be http://ss64.com/bash/source.html[sourced^]:

[NOTE]
====
For the whole hands-on, and unless stated otherwise, we assume to be working from within the `~/rnaseq` folder.

You can use the `pwd` command to check the folder you are currently in:

[source,cmd]
----
pwd
----
----
/users/rg/epalumbo
----

and move to the `rnaseq` folder if you are not there:

[source,cmd]
----
cd ~/rnaseq
----
[source,cmd]
----
pwd
----
----
/users/rg/epalumbo/rnaseq
