= RNA-seq data
:rnaseq_folder: /software/rg/rnaseq/
:env_file: {rnaseq_folder}.rnaseqenv

All the data needed for the course is stored under:

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
{rnaseq_folder}

We prepared a bash file with the commands needed to set up your environment for the hands-on. The file needs to be http://ss64.com/bash/source.html[sourced^] in your current terminal session. Run the following command in your terminal in order to do it:

[source,cmd,subs="attributes"]
----
. {env_file}
----

You can have a look at the contents of the file:

[source,cmd,subs="attributes"]
----
cat {env_file}

# environment setup for modules
export PATH=/software/as/el6.5/modules/Modules/3.2.10/bin/:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/software/as/el6.5/Tcl/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source /software/as/el6.5/modules/Modules/3.2.10/init/bash

# add modulefiles

# set R libraries path
export R_LIBS=/software/R/packages/

# add course scripts to path
export PATH=/software/rg/rnaseq/bin:$PATH

As a working folder for the hands-on we create the folder `rnaseq` in your home folder and move to it:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir -p ~/rnaseq && cd ~/rnaseq
