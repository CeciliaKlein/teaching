= ChIP-seq signal files

MACS2 produces two Bedgraph files: one called `treat_pileup`, the other is `control_lambda`.

Sort the Bedgraph file using bedtools: 
[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
bedtools sort -i peakOut/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_treat_pileup.bdg >\
                 peakOut/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_pileup_treat_pileup_sorted.bdg
----


We convert the `treat_pileup` BedGraph file to BigWig:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
bedGraphToBigWig peakOut/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_treat_pileup_sorted.bdg \
                 {rnaseq_folder}refs/genome.fa.fai \
                 peakOut/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_pileup.bw
----
// real	0m0.440s
// user	0m0.425s
// sys	0m0.013s
NOTE: Remember that, in general, you can always have a look at programs options by just typing the command name or `--help` after the command (in this case simply type `bedGraphToBigWig`).
