Create a folder for the alignment steps:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir chip-alignments
----

Create the genome index for STAR:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
mkdir chip-genomeIndex
----

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
STAR --runThreadN 2 \
     --runMode genomeGenerate \
     --genomeDir chip-genomeIndex \
     --genomeFastaFiles {rnaseq_folder}refs/genome.fa \
     --genomeSAindexNbases 11
----
// real	0m20.906s
// user	0m20.811s
// sys	0m0.591s

Run the following command to perform the mapping:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
STAR --runThreadN 2 \
     --genomeDir chip-genomeIndex \
     --readFilesIn {rnaseq_folder}data/mouse_brain_H3K4me3.fastq.gz \
     --outSAMunmapped Within \
      --outFilterMultimapNmax 10 \
     --alignSJoverhangMin 1000 \
     --alignIntronMax 1 \
     --outSAMattributes NH HI AS NM MD \
     --readFilesCommand pigz -p2 -dc \
     --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
     --outFileNamePrefix chip-alignments/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_

// user	0m40.841s
// sys	0m0.261s

NOTE: Remember that, in general, you can always have a look at programs options by just typing the command name or `--help` after the command (e.g. `STAR --help`).

When finished we can look at the bam file:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
samtools view -h chip-alignments/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam | more
----

Type kbd:[q] to exit the view.

or at the mapping statistics that come with `STAR`:

[source,cmd,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
cat chip-alignments/mouse_brain_H3K4me3_Log.final.out
