= Promoter regions of differentially expressed genes


Use bash commands to intersect the list of differentially expressed genes (DEG) with the differential H3K4me3 peaks computed in section <<Differential peaks>>.


Look at promoter regions of DEGs with and without differential peaks of H3K4me3 at the UCSC genome browser.


Do you see a relationship between H3K4me3 marking and gene expression?

How frequent is it? Use your differential peaks and DEGs to compute it.
