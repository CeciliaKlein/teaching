= Promoter regions of differentially spliced genes

Use bash commands to intersect the list of differentially spliced genes with the differential H3K4me3 peaks computed in section <<Differential peaks>>.


Look at promoter regions of alternative first exon events at the UCSC genome browser.


Do you see a relationship between chromatin features (H3K4me3 marking and the open chromatin) with the isoform expression in different tissues?
