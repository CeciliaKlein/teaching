= ChIP-seq data analysis
:experimental:

Create a directory dedicated to the analyses:

[source,cmd]
----
mkdir chip-analysis
----

And move into it:

[source,cmd]
----
cd chip-analysis
----

:leveloffset: +1

NOTE: Remember that you can always have a look at the options for all the R scripts that we are using in the analysis by typing `--help` after the command (e.g. `bedtools --help`).
